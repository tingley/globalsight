Office Converters for Office 2007
-------------------------------

All converters and their installers are built in Visual Studio 2005.
The main solution is OfficeConverters.sln, which includes all other
projects.

After you make code changes to any converter, rebuild them all in
Visual C# 2005 Express Edition (also VS 2005 with C# is ok).
 
Then you can make setup files like "Word 2007 Converter Setup.exe"
in Visual Studio 2005 standard version.
