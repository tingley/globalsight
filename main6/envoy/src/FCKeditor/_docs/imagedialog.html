<STRONG><FONT size="6">Image Dialog Options<BR></FONT></STRONG><EM>(Revised:&nbsp;04/10/2003)</EM><BR><BR>
			The new image dialog box has been implemented. There are two new useful options 
			that this document will discuss: image file upload and image repository 
			browsing.<BR><BR>
			<BR>
			<STRONG><FONT size="5">Image File Upload</FONT></STRONG>
			<BR><BR>
			The editor doesn’t manage the effective file upload system. It is limited to 
			the editing system. But it can talk to a user custom file upload system. In 
			this way, the end user (developer) can control and decide what is the better 
			solution for it’s needs. Someone will save it on the file system. Other in the 
			database. And another developer need to perform some image manipulations after 
			the upload is completed. The preferred language is another big problem. So we 
			let you decide what is the better way to manage it.<BR>
			<BR>
			In any case, some sample working solutions can be found at <STRONG>/FCKeditor_dir/_filemanager/upload</STRONG>.
			<FONT color="#ff0000">Attention: all these samples use the folder “/UserImages/” of 
				your web site to save the uploaded files. So be sure that you have the right 
				security rights set.<BR>
			</FONT>
			<BR>
			If you want to implement your custom one pay attention to these instructions:<BR>
			The posted file is named “<STRONG>FCKeditor_File</STRONG> ”. So use this name to 
			process the request.<BR>
			After you have processed the file, write in the browser something like this:<BR>
<PRE>
    &lt;SCRIPT language=javascript&gt;
        <STRONG>window.opener.setImage('" + sFileURL + "') ;</STRONG>
        window.close() ;
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>

			This will set the new image in the image dialog box and close your custom page.<BR>
			<BR>
			You can set the desired upload page in the <STRONG>fck_config.js</STRONG> file. 
			Other upload options are also set there.<BR>
			<BR>
			Only <STRONG>JPG</STRONG>, <STRONG>GIF</STRONG> and <STRONG>PNG</STRONG> 
files are allowed.<BR><BR>Warning: the Image Upload feature is not working over 
IE 5.0 (FCKeditor version 
			0.9.4 beta).<BR><BR>
			<BR>
			<STRONG><FONT size="5">Image Repository Browsing</FONT></STRONG>
			<BR><BR>
			Like the image upload process, the editor doesn’t manage files on the server. But 
			in the same way you can define a custom web page to do that work. You can find 
			some samples at <STRONG>/FCKeditor_dir/_filemanager/browse</STRONG> .<BR>
			<BR>
			If you want to implement your custom browser pay attention to these 
			instructions:<BR>
			After the user selected the file, write in the browser something like this:
<PRE>
    &lt;SCRIPT language=javascript&gt;
        <STRONG>window.setImage('" + sFileURL + "') ;</STRONG>
        window.close() ;
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
			This will set the new image in the image dialog box and close your custom page.<BR>
			<BR>
			You can set the desired browsing page in the <STRONG>fck_config.js</STRONG> file. Other image 
browser options are also set 
there.
