				</FONT></STRONG><EM>(Revised:&nbsp;23rd July 2003)</EM></P>
		<P>The languages files must be created inside the lang directory of the project. 
			You can use the file <STRONG>en.js</STRONG> as the base file for your 
			translations. The file names respect the <STRONG>RFC 1766</STRONG> standards 
			(but in lowercase). So, for example, a file for the <STRONG>Portuguese language</STRONG>
			should be called “<STRONG>pt.js</STRONG>”.</P>
		<P>Translation could also be localized for a specific country. In this case, for 
			example, a Brazilian Portuguese translation file should be called <STRONG>pt-br.js</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>The client’s language auto detection system uses the first available language 
			that best fits the client settings. For example, if a client computer is set to 
			Brazilian Portuguese and there is no pt-br.js file available, the pt.js is used 
			if available. If not, the default language is used (from the fck_config.js 
			file).</P>
		<P>To test the translations you need to add a line in the fck_lang.js file like:
			<BR>
			<STRONG>AvailableLangs["pt"] = true ;</STRONG></P>
		<P>An important think is to save the files in a <STRONG>UTF-8</STRONG> encoded 
			format. In other case, some strange characters could appear instead of some 
			special chars, like accented letters, symbols, etc.
		</P>
		<P>All translated files must be sent by e-mail to <A href="mailto:fckeditor@fredck.com">
				fckeditor@fredck.com</A>.
