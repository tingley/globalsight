			<LI>
				<STRONG>ATTENTION: For PHP users</STRONG>: The editor was changed and now uses <STRONG>
					htmlspecialchars</STRONG> instead of <STRONG>htmlentities</STRONG>
			when handling the initial value. It should works well, but please make some 
			tests before upgrading definitively. If there is any problem just uncomment the 
			line in the fckeditor.php file (and send me a message!).
			<LI>
				The editor is now integrated with <STRONG>ieSpell</STRONG> (<A href="http://www.iespell.com">http://www.iespell.com</A>) 
				for <STRONG>Spell Checking</STRONG>. You can configure the download URL in 
			then fck_config.js file. Thanks to Sanjay Sharma. (ieSpell is free for personal 
			use but must be paid for commercial use)
			<LI>
				<STRONG>Table</STRONG> and <STRONG>table cell</STRONG> dialogs has been 
				changed. Now you can <STRONG>select the class</STRONG>
			you want to be applied. Thanks to Alexander Lezos.

					Feature-865378</A>]A new <STRONG>upload support is available for ASP</STRONG>. 
			It uses the /UserImages/ folder in the root of the web site as the files 
			container and a counter controlled by the upload.cnt file. Both must have write 
			permissions set to the IUSR_xxx user. Thanks to Trax and Juanjo.

			even if HTML has no support for TAB. Now when the user presses the TAB key a 
			configurable number of spaces (&amp;nbsp;) is added. Take a look at 
			config.TabSpaces on the fck_config.js file. No action is performed if it is set 
			to zero. The default value is 4. Thanks to Phil Hassey.

				It's now possible to configure the editor the insert a <STRONG>&lt;BR&gt; tag 
					instead of &lt;P&gt;</STRONG> when the user presses the <STRONG>&lt;Enter&gt;</STRONG>
				key. Take a look at the fck_config.js configuration file for the "<STRONG>UseBROnCarriageReturn</STRONG>"

				Language updates for <STRONG>Romanian</STRONG>.
			<LI>
				It's now possible to <STRONG>override</STRONG> any of the <STRONG>editor's 
					configurations</STRONG>
			(for now it's implemented just for JavaScript, ASPX and HTC modules). See 
			_test/test.html for a sample. I'm now waiting for the Community for the ASP, 
			CFM and PHP versions.
			<LI>
				A new method is available for <STRONG>PHP</STRONG> users. It's called <STRONG>ReturnFCKeditor</STRONG>. 
				It works exactly like CreateFCKeditor, but it <STRONG>returns a string with the 
					HTML</STRONG>
			for the editor instead of output it (echo). This feature is useful for people 
			who are working with Smarty Templates or something like that. Thanks to Timothy 
			J. Finucane.
			<LI>
				Many people have had problems with <STRONG>international characters</STRONG> over
				<STRONG>PHP</STRONG>. I had also the same problem. PHP have strange problems 
				with character encoding. The code hasn't been changed but just saved again with 
				Western European encoding. <STRONG>Now it works well</STRONG> in my system.<BR>
			Take a look also at the "default_charset" configuration option at the php.ini 
			file. It doesn't seem to be an editor's problem but a PHP issue.
			<LI>
				The "<STRONG>testsubmit.php</STRONG>" file now strips the "<STRONG>Magic Quotes</STRONG>
			" that are automatically added by PHP on form posts.

			<LI>
				The <STRONG>Text as Plain Text</STRONG> toolbar <STRONG>icon</STRONG> has been 
				changed <STRONG>to avoid confusion</STRONG>
			with the Normal Paste or. Thanks to Kaupo Kalda.
			<LI>
				The file <STRONG>dhtmled.cab has been removed</STRONG>
			from the package. It's not needed to the editor to work and caused some 
			confusion for a few users.
			<LI>
				The <STRONG>editor's content</STRONG> now <STRONG>doesn't loose the focus</STRONG>
			when the user clicks with the mouse in a toolbar button.
			<LI>
				On <STRONG>drag-and-drop</STRONG> operations the data to be inserted in the 
				editor is now <STRONG>converted to plain text</STRONG> when the "<STRONG>ForcePasteAsPlainText</STRONG>" 
				configuration is set to <STRONG>true</STRONG>.
			<LI>
				The <STRONG>image browser</STRONG> sample in PHP now <STRONG>sorts the files</STRONG>
			by name. Thanks to Sergey Lupashko.
			<LI>
				Two <STRONG>new configuration</STRONG> options are available to <STRONG>turn on/off 
					by default</STRONG> the "<STRONG>Show Borders</STRONG>" and "<STRONG>Show 
					Details</STRONG>" commands.
			<LI>
				Some <STRONG>characters have been removed</STRONG> from the "<STRONG>Insert Special 
					Chars</STRONG>" dialog box because they were causing encoding problems 
			in some languages. Thanks to Abomb Hua.
			<LI>
				<STRONG>JSP</STRONG> versions of the <STRONG>image and file upload and browsing</STRONG>

			feature (Thanks to Karl von Randow).
			<LI>
				The <STRONG>Table dialog box</STRONG>
			now handles the Style width and height set in the table (Thanks to Roberto

			<LI>
				For the <STRONG>Image dialog box:</STRONG>
				<UL>
					<LI>
					No image is shown in the preview pane if no image has been set.

			changing its properties. The problem is solved.
			<LI>
				Due to some problems in the XHTML cleaning (content duplication when the source 
				HTML is dirty and malformed), the <STRONG>XHTML support is turned off by default</STRONG>
			from this version. You can still change this behavior and turn it on&nbsp;in 
			the configuration file.
			<LI>
				Some little updates on the <STRONG>English </STRONG>
			language file.
			<LI>
			A few addition of missing entries on all languages files (translations for

			<LI>
				The "<STRONG>Multi Language</STRONG>" system is now available. This version 
				ships with English and Italian versions completed. Other languages will be 
				available soon. The editor automatically detects the client language and sets 
				all labels, tooltips and dialog boxes to it, if available. The auto detection 
				and the default language can be set in the <STRONG>fck_config.file</STRONG>.
			<LI>
				Two files can now be created to isolate customizations code from the original 
				source code of the editor: <STRONG>fckeditor.config.js</STRONG> and <STRONG>fckeditor.custom.js</STRONG>. 
			Create these files in the root folder of your web site, if needed. The first 
			one can be used to add or override configurations set on fck_config.js. The 
			second one is used for custom actions and behaviors.
			<LI>
			A problem with relative links and images like "/test/test.doc" has been solved. 
			In prior versions, only with XHTML support enabled, the URL was changed to 
			something like "http://www.mysite.xxx/test/test.doc" (The domain was 
			automatically added). Now the XHTML cleaning procedure gets the URLs exactly 
			how they are defined in the editor’s HTML.

			A new dialog box for the "Link" command is available. Now you can upload and 
			browse the server exactly like the image dialog box. It's also possible to
