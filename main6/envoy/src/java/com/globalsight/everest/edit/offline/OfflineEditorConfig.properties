# Annotations can add a lot of bulk to an RTF file, sometimes creating files over
# 3 or 4 megabytes in size. This can adversely affect the user who needs to load the
# file in an editor. Annotations do not have an adverse affect on download performance
# since RTF files are highly compressible for download. When the number of segments
# (specified below) is reached, the RTFWriter will stop inserting annotations 
# and begin inserting hyperlinks that directly link the segment to the corresponding
# entry in the offline resource pages. This "cut-off-switch" occurs on a per file basis.
