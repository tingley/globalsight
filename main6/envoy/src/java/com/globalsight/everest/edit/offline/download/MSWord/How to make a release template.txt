DEVELOPMENT TEMPLATE:

The template called "gs4win.dot" which is located at the root of
com\globalsight\everest\edit\offline\download\MSWord is the development template.
This template should never be released "as-is" since it contains testing code and
all the macros are unprotected. Instead, this template should be copied, renamed,
and otherwise prepped for release as described below.

HOW TO SHRINK TEMPLATE:

I have noticed (since moving to Word 2003) that the template gets bloated 
over time while coding.
I discovered that I can shrink the template by doing the following.
1) Make a copy of the template
2) Open it in Word 2000
3) Open VBA (ALT+F11)
4) Dirty the template VBA code (add/delete a space anywhere)
5) Save the template
The size will often be greatly reduced.
You should do this as part of each major release. This is included in the steps below.

HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE:

Note: See "how to Shrink" first
1) Copy gs4win.dot to a temporary location.
2) Rename gs4win.dot to AOR-Template.dot (case sensitive)
3) open the new template (AOR-Template.dot) in word as a document 
   (enable macros if asked)
4) Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA editor
5) Right click on the project called AOR-Template (left window)
6) Select TemplateProjectProperties->Protection
7) Click "lock project for viewing"
8) Enter and confirm the password "global2000"
9) Select and expand "Modules" in the left panel
10) run "untiTestAll" from the "test" module
11) Delete the "test" and "dev" modules
12) Sign the code "Tools->Digital Sig" (see details below)
13) Check Tools References and remove any unsused/unnecessary references

	Current references used:
	[x] Visual Basic For Applications
	[x] Microsoft Word 11.0 Object library 
	    (version varies when opened on other office versions)
	[x] Microsoft Office 11.0 Object library 
	    (version varies when opened other on office versions)
	[x] Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object library

	NOTE: If you get a runtime startup error immediately when
	      using the template, check Tools->References while
	      running on the problematic machine. 

	      If a required reference is missing, the word "MISSING"
	      will appear in front of it. 

	      The missing library will have to be installed >>if<< it
	      is required by our code. 

	      If it is not required, remove the reference and rebuild
	      the release template.

14) Save the template
15) Close the VBA editor
16) Close the document (and save if asked)
17) Test the template with a previously downloaded job by copying 
    this template over the job's template.
18) Test all functions
19) Check out the current release template (AOR-Template.dot) from 
    com\globalsight\everest\edit\offline\download\MSWord\TemplateRelease
20) Copy the new template over the old
21) DEFLATE the template :-)

	During coding using Word 2003, the template can get very large
	for unknown reasons.

	The size can be greatly reduced by doing the following:
	- open the template in Word 2000
	- make a dummy change to the VBA code
	- then save
	The above often has reduced the template from 1.2K to 500k
	This will help download.

22) check it in.

Note: the build process will copy the releaseTemplate to the correct
production directory during build.


HOW TO SIGN THE CODE:

Please note, a major part of the security is how you manage and protect your key.

It is not advisable to install the key (as an “exportable”
private key) on too many machines or to let the password for the
installer be commonly known (they suggest a safety deposit box for
both).

If the key is needed on other machines, you might consider importing
it as a "non-exportable" key. That way it cannot be exported and/or
moved to other machines. Right now it is checked-in as described below
and there is *this* readme which includes the password.

I’m leaving it like this unless someone wants to go farther and move
the certificate offsite.

It is also worth noting that the signature was purchased and
originally downloaded by Clove on his machine.

It was then moved using the process described below to BillB's
machine. So as of this writing it is only usable to sign code from
these two machines and it is exportable on those two machines.
[Mon Sep 26 22:41:10 2005 CvdL: I installed it as exportable, too.]

1) Read this URL to get an overview.
http://www.verisign.com/developer/rsc/gd/mo2000/index.html

2) Read this URL if you need to move our digital certificate to another machine.

   https://digitalid.verisign.com/client/help/transporting.htm#5

   As of this writing it is only installed on Clove's, BillB’s and
   CvdL's machines.

	Our digital signature is checked-in at :
	\envoy\src\java\com\globalsight\everest\edit\offline\download\MSWord

	This file is called:  gs_digital_sig_ms_auth.pfx

	The password to import this private key (see URL in step two)
	is = "password".

	Once this private registry key is installed on your machine,
	it (meaning the signature) can be used to sign any MS-Office
	code from your machine.

	Note: I do not know if we need the other file that Clove set
	along inside "gsofflinecert.zip" but I checked it in anyway.
	All I used was the pfx file to import the key to my machine.
	The signature was originally purchased and downloaded on
	Cloves machine.

3) Don’t forget to make this registry entry on your machine:

   HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\VBA\Security\TimeStampURL

   to: http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll

4) Once you have installed the certificate, open the offline template
   in Word. Then press ALT+F11 to open the VBA editor.

   Select the project you want to sign in the left hand window. Select
   Tools->digital certificate from the main VBA menu.

   Press "Choose" if the certificate does not appear. If you have
   imported the certificate correctly as described in step #2, it
   should appear in the chooser window. Choose the cert and then press OK.

   The project that you have selected in the left-hand window will now
   be signed. Save the project.
