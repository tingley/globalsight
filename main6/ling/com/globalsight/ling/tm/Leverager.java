/**
The Leverager is responsible for finding exact and/or fuzzy matches for Tuvs 
inside of a leverage group. A leverage group is currently defined as a page 
(static content) or a database record (dynamic content).
<p>
A leverage group provides a tighter context for the matching algorithms.
Any match found inside the same leverage group is considered of better quality 
than matches found in the TM at large. Internally the Leverager maintains a 
collection of TmHits. For each TmHit the Leverager creates rows in the 
LEVERAGE_MATCH table.
<p>
    Contents of the LEVERAGE_MATCH Table:
        Pointer to the original source Tuv.
        Pointer to the matching source Tuv.
        Copy of the target Tuv. Possibly with stripped codes.
        Pointer to original target Tuv.
        Match Type.
        Fuzzy Score.
        Priority.
        Locale ID.
<p>
Use Cases:
1. Leverage only against a leverage group (page or DB record). Also known as
   "leverage for re-import".
2. Leverage against the entire TM.

    Leverage Against the Entire TM
        Used during all imports. But really only useful when there are 
         preexisting TM's , or when some content in the current project TM has 
         been translated. The later implies that we have the ability to localize 
         the project piecemeal. This is always the case for dynamic content, 
         but seldom the case for static content.
        Search for matches across multiple TMs. Prefer matches within the 
         same leverage group. TMs higher in the list will be preferred.
        Use exclude types (LeverageExcludeTypes). The norm is to leverage 
         only translatable content, but the behavior is totally dependent on 
         the LeverageExcludeTypes list.
        Only a match if the locType (translatable or localizable) is the same.
        NOTE: Don't match on the input segment itself!
